              I am a sixth year PhD student in economics at UC Berkeley. My
              fields are industrial organization, public economics and household
              finance. Before starting at my PhD, I was a research assistant in
              the Financial Structure section at the Federal Reserve Board for
              two years.

              Regulation of loan prices is a controversial policy tool.
              Proponents argue that regulation protects borrowers from high
              prices, while detractors argue that restricting prices prevents
              borrowers from obtaining credit. Firm profits play a role in the
              effects of price regulation. If lenders are profitable enough to
              offer lower prices while continuing lending activity, borrowers
              can benefit from price regulation. In this paper, I study a 2014
              price regulation in the manufactured home loan market.
              Manufactured homes, known colloquially as “mobile homes” or
              “trailers”, are a source of affordable housing for approximately
              17 million people in the United States. I find that loan prices
              fell in response to the 2014 regulation while a similar number of
              loans with prices near the cap were made, suggesting that
              borrowers benefited. This response is driven by the largest firm
              in the market, which made about 90% of affected loans. I show that
              this firm charges higher prices than other firms to observably
              similar borrowers, which fits with the finding that they were able
              to continue lending activity after the restriction was
              implemented. I then consider how stricter restrictions would
              affect borrowers and lenders. In order to conduct this
              counterfactual analysis, I develop and estimate a model of supply
              and demand for manufactured home loans, estimate borrowers' price
              sensitivity, and recover markups. Under progressively stricter
              rate restrictions, I find that borrowers initially gain surplus
              from lower prices but are eventually worse off due to the fall in
              credit supply.

              “Mortgage Servicing and Household Financial Health” (with Manisha
              Padi and Chen Meng)

            <p class="indent">
              Debt servicers directly interact with household borrowers, make
              key decisions about creditor leniency, and have been targeted to
              help alleviate financial distress by regulators during the 2008
              financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the 2013
              introduction of mortgage servicing regulations by the Consumer
              Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), we study whether requiring
              servicers to warn delinquent consumers and to process loss
              mitigation applications prior to foreclosure improves consumer
              outcomes. Data from loan level mortgage performance data shows
              that servicing regulations significantly improve loan performance,
              lowering the probability that a loan ends up in loss mitigation or
              in foreclosure. Moreover, using linked credit data, we show that
              servicer-driven, rather than household-driven, shifts in loan
              performance generate changes in households’ financial health.
              Overall, our results imply that servicer regulation has the
              potential to alleviate debt burdens in both crisis and non-crisis
              environments.
